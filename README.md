#💊 Medicine Recommendation System with Cancer Tagging

This project combines the power of AI and LLMs to assist in healthcare by recommending medicines based on user symptoms and tagging unstructured cancer-related complaints into structured categories.

#📌 Project Overview
Medicine Recommendation: Suggests appropriate medicines based on symptoms using a rule-based and AI-augmented approach.

Cancer Complaint Tagging: Uses LLMs (like OpenAI/Ollama) to classify free-text medical complaints into:

Complaint

Cause

Correction

Streamlit UI: Built with an interactive frontend for ease of use by medical staff, researchers, and analysts.

Automated EDA: LLM-driven data summarization and visualization for deeper insights.

#🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Streamlit

LangChain

OpenAI / Ollama

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

scikit-learn

#🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate symptom-to-drug mapping using external APIs (like DrugBank or MedlinePlus)

Fine-tune LLMs for improved cancer taxonomy classification

Add multilingual complaint tagging support
